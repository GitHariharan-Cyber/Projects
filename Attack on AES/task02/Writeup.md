To achieve the task of decrypting a ciphertext with two keys (k1 and k2) that produce different plaintexts (p1 and p2), you can utilize a straightforward symmetric key encryption approach, like XOR (exclusive OR) operation or a substitution cipher.

The commonly used substitution cipher involves replacing plaintext characters with corresponding ciphertext characters, which can work on individual letters or larger groups of letters. However, if the original encoding doesn't use English alphabets, the substitution cipher isn't applicable. So, for ciphertext like "ˆÃã§©," we can rule out the substitution cipher.

In this context, using XOR for decryption is a practical and straightforward method. XOR is a bitwise operation that is both symmetric (the order of operands doesn't matter) and reversible (it can be undone). Additionally, since you have two plaintexts (Known Plaintext Attack), you can calculate a portion of the encryption keys using XOR itself.
